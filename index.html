    <h2> Creative Statement</h2>
    <p> 
      Hello everyone! My name is Emily Li! I enjoy making games and drawing.:D
      Even though I'm not that good at doing any of them but I'm glad I can make them.
      I really like to do game designs and make the game from scratch.
      I usually draw in an anime/cartoon style.
      It's more of a drawing of the character than the background.
      I also like photography but it's not a much as drawing and game development.
      The type of media/design I want to make is video games but at the same time, film.
      It will have some animation, photography and more!
      I want to make it fun and show some part of my life.
      While being true to myself and show my personality in it.
      My inspiration I would get for my project is from my emotions and how I see from my surrounds during that moment or later on.
      My cousin plays a part in the inspiration since she does art which inspired me to use animation as part of the media.
      I will also put some inspiration from what I liked or things that look cute.
      I want to see the entertaining part of the theme to put it in a way to make people see if there is some kind of meaning to it
      or find some meaning to it. It might have another type of media being put into this website if my inspiration leads me to it.
      I can't wait for all of you guys to see what I'm going to do for this website. Please enjoy.

    <h3> Reflection:</h3>
    <p>
      My experience while setting up the site wasn't as bad as I thought. 
      I have prior experience with coding in other languages and this HTML is much easier than the other.
      This experience got me back to loving coding and wanting to learn more of it.
      This experience of setting up makes me see that making a website is also media and the growing amount of techology
      slowly merging to media. The challenges I faced was using github because I never have used it at all even when I was 
      in computer science and it's something I didn't get used to yet. It's also hard to try to understand why it's not 
      working because I still don't know how it works towards html. I learned that the longer you coding it, the more you
      understand by looking at the same code for hours while trying to understand why isn't working. I also, learned HTML 
      are much easier because people who learned html before me and made videos about it. It helps lot while making the website. 
      I hope to gain exprience in media and art as itself. While increasing more of my game development experiences for the future
      and use what I learned about Media into my everyday life. I want to learn other types of media to help my career as an artist
      and a pa. I want to understand the growing populations of media and entertainment through these media. I hope it increase my
      love for media as a whole.
