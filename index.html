    <h1> Emily Li's MEDPL 150 Profolio</h1>
    <h2> Creative Statement</h2>
    <p> Hello everyone! My name is Emily Li! I enjoy making games and drawing.:D </p> 
    <p> Even though I'm not that good at doing any of them but I'm glad I can make them.</p>
    <p> I really like to do game designs and make the game from scratch.</p>
    <p> I usually draw in an anime/cartoon style.</p>
    <p> It's more of a drawing of the character than the background.</p>
    <p> I also like photography but it's not a much as drawing and game development.</p>
    
    <p> They type of media/design I want to make is video games but at the same time, film.</p>
    <p> It will have some animation, photography and more!</p>
    <p> I want to make it fun and show some part of my life.</p>
    <p> While being true to myself and show my personality in it.</p>
    <p> My inspiration I would get for my project is from my emotions and how I see from my surrounds during that moment or later on.</p>
    <p> My cousin plays the part of the inspiration since she do art which inspired me to use animation as part of the media.</p>
    <p> I will also put some inspiration from what I liked or things that look cute.</p>
    <p> I want to see the entertaining part of the theme to put it in a way to make people see if there is some kind of meaning to it</p>
    <p> or find some meaning to it.</p>
    <p> It might have another type of media being put into this website if my inspiration leads me to it.</p>
    <p> I can't wait for all of you guys to see what I'm going to do for the website. Please enjoy.</p>
