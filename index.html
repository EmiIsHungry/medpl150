    <h2> Creative Statement</h2>
    <p> 
      Hello everyone! My name is Emily Li! I enjoy making games and drawing.:D
      Even though I'm not that good at doing any of them but I'm glad I can make them.
      I really like to do game designs and make the game from scratch.
      I usually draw in an anime/cartoon style.
      It's more of a drawing of the character than the background.
      I also like photography but it's not a much as drawing and game development.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The type of media/design I want to make is video games but at the same time, film.
      It will have some animation, photography and more!
      I want to make it fun and show some part of my life.
      While being true to myself and show my personality in it.
      My inspiration I would get for my project is from my emotions and how I see from my surrounds during that moment or later on.
      My cousin plays the part of the inspiration since she do art which inspired me to use animation as part of the media.
      I will also put some inspiration from what I liked or things that look cute.
      I want to see the entertaining part of the theme to put it in a way to make people see if there is some kind of meaning to it
      or find some meaning to it.</p>
      It might have another type of media being put into this website if my inspiration leads me to it.
      I can't wait for all of you guys to see what I'm going to do for the website. Please enjoy.
  </p>
